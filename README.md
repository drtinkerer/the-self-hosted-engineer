# the-self-hosted-engineer

Welcome **The self hosted engineer**, a journey into the world of homelabs, self-hosting, and cloud computing using open-source tools and free-tier services.
This book is not just a technical guide—it’s a collection of my experiences, challenges, and insights as I build and manage my own infrastructure using Raspberry Pi clusters, dusty old Lenovo/Dell laptops from 2015, spare routers, and various cloud and SaaS solutions to support the softwares.

In today's world, cloud computing and DevOps practices are shaping the way we deploy and manage applications. But what if you could build and experiment with these technologies right from your home? 
That’s exactly what this book is about—creating a self-hosted, cost-effective homelab using a mix of open-source software and free-tier cloud services.

Whether you're an aspiring DevOps engineer, a tech enthusiast, or someone who just loves tinkering with servers, networking, and automation, this book will guide you through setting up your own infrastructure, experimenting with Kubernetes, automating workflows, and integrating cloud services—all while keeping costs minimal.

Through real-world examples and practical insights, I aim to share everything I’ve learned, making it easier for you to build, experiment, and scale your own homelab.

Let’s dive in!
